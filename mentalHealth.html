Coronavirus is changing not only our external world but also our inner within. Several reports and news articles have been published that say how the number of mental health patients got increased in this period. So I went a little bit ahead and did research on the mental health impact of COVID 19 and lined out a novel approach to face the problem.<br/></div><div class="text-block-23">Worry Not won D'source Corona Design award.</div><div class="text-block-24">This was an amazing experience. Some key achievements listed below:</div><ul class="list-6"><li><strong>Learning Design Process and Thinking </strong> This project has taught me how to effectively apply design process to solve the problem. </li><li><strong>Psychology is backbone of Design </strong> Psychology provides evidence for design decision. It provides multiple view-point.</li><li><strong>Won the design award. </strong>It&#x27;s worth noting that the best designs are not a result of the designer on the team. Each person from design, engineering and business was able to contribute to the solution which resulted in a very collaborative and impressive result.</li></ul></div></div>

I noticed that non-technical people are unlimited with their ideas due to their lack of technical knowledge; whereas technical people are grounded in reality and can be a great sounding board for what is possible. </li><li><strong>Design thinking is key to effective products. </strong>This lean framework really helped to shape the workshops and discussions with the team as it allowed me to stay focussed and on track throughout the entire hackathon.</li><li><strong>First impressions first. </strong>Hackathons are all about selling the dream. Putting the user experience first is vital because people will only care about how they use the product. The simplicity of our app&#x27;s experience helped to differentiate our proposition and stand out.  </li></ul></div></div><div class="section-35"><div class="div-block-61"></div><h1 class="heading-37">More projects</h1><div class="w-layout-grid grid-13"><a href="/work/rokt" class="w-inline-block"><div class="div-link"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x.png" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-2000.png 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x.png 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 87vw" alt=""/></div></a><a href="/work/sealadder" class="div-link w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x.png" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-2000.png 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x.png 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 87vw" alt=""/></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section-48"><div class="footer-wrap"><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h2>Let&#x27;s connect</h2></div><div class="text-block-6"><a href="#" class="text-link"><span class="text-span-5">Get in touch for opportunities or just to say hi! 👋</span></a></div><div class="div-block-3"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glorialo94/" target="_blank" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d34568d47f4bb217099258c_Linkedin%402x.svg" width="40" height="35" alt=""/></a><a href="mailto:gloria.lo@live.com.au?subject=Hello!" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d3458ab6b1d5c375a1f9e6c_33700.svg" width="45" height="40" alt=""/></a><a href="https://medium.com/@gloria2809.gl/" target="_blank" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5c9716d3435bfc4e4b4f75b0_1_emiGsBgJu2KHWyjluhKXQw.png" width="35" height="35" alt=""/></a></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="container"></div></div><div class="section"><div class="container"></div></div><div class="section"></div><div class="section"></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.220afd743d.js" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/js/webflow.06eb1e924.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
