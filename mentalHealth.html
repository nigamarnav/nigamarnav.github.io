<div><div class="div-block-83"><div class="section-37"><h1 class="heading-34">Background</h1><div class="text-block-18">Greta Thunberg is one of the many individuals of our generation concerned about the future of our planet and the need for immediate action to combat climate change. As part of the weekend hackathon, my team and I wanted to tackle this issue and raise awareness of how individuals can contribute to lessening their impact on the environment through simple daily tasks.<br/></div><div class="text-block-23">Worry Not won D'source Corona Design award.</div><div class="text-block-24">I was the sole designer on the team alongside 1 business analyst and 4 engineers. I was responsible for the product design and UX/UI experience for the app. Whilst the hackathon was short, some key achievements listed below:</div><ul class="list-6"><li><strong>Applied design sprints to inform our process. </strong>I was able to effectively apply the design sprints process to identify the problem, ideate on the solution, prototype and implement the final product. </li><li><strong>Executed end to end. </strong> The fact that the engineers were able to code the final designs in such a short period of time demonstrated our ability to execute and ship features as a team.</li><li><strong>Won the design award. </strong>It&#x27;s worth noting that the best designs are not a result of the designer on the team. Each person from design, engineering and business was able to contribute to the solution which resulted in a very collaborative and impressive result.</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div class="div-block-79"><div class="section-30"><h1 class="heading-33-copy">Understanding the problem</h1><div class="text-block-15">I conducted a brainstorming workshop with the team to uncover pains felt by individuals. It was revealed that:<br/></div><ul class="list-4"><li>Individuals were unaware of their direct impact of their water, electricity and consumption on the environment<br/></li><li>Individuals wanted to take action on reducing their carbon footprint but didn&#x27;t know where to begin<br/></li><li>Individuals would be more conscious of their actions if their impact was quantifiable and measurable<br/></li></ul></div>
<div><div class="div-block-65"><div class="section-21"><h1 class="heading-33-copy">Product vision and solution</h1><div><div class="text-block-27">From these findings, we decided as a product to identify key business goals:</div><ul class="list-4"><li>We want users to understand the impact of their current usage<br/></li><li>We want users to take actions to reduce their water, waste and electricity usage<br/></li><li>We want users to understand how their actions positively affect change<br/></li></ul></div><div class="text-block-25"><p class="paragraph-9">As a starting point, we each did some market research on competitors to investigate the current offerings in the market and take inspiration from particular features that we liked about each app.<br/></p><p class="paragraph-9">I then conducted a 15 minute sketching session to encourage each member of the team to draw out their vision of the solution. <br/></p></div></div></div><div><div><div class="section-30"><h1 class="heading-33-copy">Defining the MVP</h1><p class="paragraph-9">Based on the sketching sessions, it was revealed that there were commonalties in the product vision.

I was extremely fortunate to have worked with some incredibly bright and talented female engineers and business analysts to come up with a product in a short period of time.<br/><br/>Some key takeaways from this hackathon are that:<br/></div><ul class="list-8"><li><strong>The best designs come from collaboration. </strong> It was inspiring to see how each person was able to bring to the table a different perspective during the sketching sessions. I noticed that non-technical people are unlimited with their ideas due to their lack of technical knowledge; whereas technical people are grounded in reality and can be a great sounding board for what is possible. </li><li><strong>Design thinking is key to effective products. </strong>This lean framework really helped to shape the workshops and discussions with the team as it allowed me to stay focussed and on track throughout the entire hackathon.</li><li><strong>First impressions first. </strong>Hackathons are all about selling the dream. Putting the user experience first is vital because people will only care about how they use the product. The simplicity of our app&#x27;s experience helped to differentiate our proposition and stand out.  </li></ul></div></div><div class="section-35"><div class="div-block-61"></div><h1 class="heading-37">More projects</h1><div class="w-layout-grid grid-13"><a href="/work/rokt" class="w-inline-block"><div class="div-link"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x.png" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x-p-2000.png 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c3147f4bb58ab986a14_c%401x.png 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 87vw" alt=""/></div></a><a href="/work/sealadder" class="div-link w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x.png" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x-p-2000.png 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d340c2e47f4bb81cb986a04_a%401x.png 2500w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 90vw, 87vw" alt=""/></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section-48"><div class="footer-wrap"><div class="rich-text-block w-richtext"><h2>Let&#x27;s connect</h2></div><div class="text-block-6"><a href="#" class="text-link"><span class="text-span-5">Get in touch for opportunities or just to say hi! 👋</span></a></div><div class="div-block-3"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/glorialo94/" target="_blank" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d34568d47f4bb217099258c_Linkedin%402x.svg" width="40" height="35" alt=""/></a><a href="mailto:gloria.lo@live.com.au?subject=Hello!" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5d3458ab6b1d5c375a1f9e6c_33700.svg" width="45" height="40" alt=""/></a><a href="https://medium.com/@gloria2809.gl/" target="_blank" class="link-block-6 w-inline-block"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/5c9716d3435bfc4e4b4f75b0_1_emiGsBgJu2KHWyjluhKXQw.png" width="35" height="35" alt=""/></a></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="container"></div></div><div class="section"><div class="container"></div></div><div class="section"></div><div class="section"></div><script src="https://d3e54v103j8qbb.cloudfront.net/js/jquery-3.4.1.min.220afd743d.js" type="text/javascript" integrity="sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script><script src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c80ff16b78f1322a4a9d105/js/webflow.06eb1e924.js" type="text/javascript"></script><!--[if lte IE 9]><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/placeholders/3.0.2/placeholders.min.js"></script><![endif]--></body></html>
